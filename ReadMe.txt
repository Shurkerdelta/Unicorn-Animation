Front legs:
Three links

Back Leg:
Four links

Don't count hooves as "attached" to lower leg section

Keys:
0 - lay down Pose
1 - Rearing Up Pose
2 - Head Stand Pose
3 - Animation galloping around sphere
4 - change direction, cw/ccw, then continue 3
5 - change speed WIP, issues with not work/causeing crashing

Note on poses and reseting animation:
The poses will occur where the unicorn is when pressed and when animation is resumed
the unicorn will conintue movement from that point. Thought these would be more interesting.

Planned to have animation into static poses, but started later then I wanted and don't have
the time to implement it. Animation out of pose back into animation of circling the sphere
was also planned.

LegSpeed - set at 6 as that was orginal, seems a tad fast for speed around sphere, 
but 3,4,5 all seem a tad too slow, so left with 6. If I got the change speed working 
I would have increased both leg speed and degree change per tick.


Materials used...
Pictures of horses
Slow motion videos of horses galloping
So much so that my ads have started showing horse related stuff...

CHANGES FROM ORGINAL
Got ride of the weird rotation on the body as could not see what it was doing, 
but it would cause the horse to rise into the air when it was moving around the circle.

Lowered up and down motion as horse as they don't seem like they do that. Added mane
to help with appreance of moving.

*** Fixed the bug with 5 now works for leg speed, but not "speed" around sphere.
See if I can get that added in time.

***YES!!! GOT IT WORKING WITH 15MIN TO SPARE...
Should make mane move more with speed, but I am happy.
